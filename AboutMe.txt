I am a Computer Science major in my junior year at UNCG. I'm into music,
basketball, and fashion. I hope I can get a high paying tech job once I
get my degree.

I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, 
and a BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like puzzles and Lego; Wordle is okay too, I guess.
