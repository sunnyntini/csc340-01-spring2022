I am a junior in the Computer Science department, I enjoy video games, nerdy movies and shows, and exploring abandoned buildings.

I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, 
and a BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like puzzles and Lego; Wordle is okay too, I guess.
